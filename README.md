# This is a repo for my own personal portfolio

This is a work in progress and is not to be taken seriously yet. I will add more functionality to the website as time goes by and I learn more about web development.

The current main branch has been implemented with massive help from ChatGPT-4 by prompting it with layman language due to my limited knowledge of CSS and HTML.

## On my TODO list:
* Make the design better
* Give the website a theme
* Show off some projects in a nice way
* Include some dynamic elements
* I will also need to practice writing better commit messages ...
